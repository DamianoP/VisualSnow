# VisualSnow developed by [Damiano Perri](https://www.damianoperri.it/), [Osvaldo Gervasi](https://ogervasi.unipg.it/), [Marco Simonetti](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marco-Simonetti-6) from the University of Perugia

This application attempts to simulates what people with Visual Snow see.
I developed this programme to raise awareness of the issue, as many people are not even aware of the problem.
This application can also be used to show others our level of Visual Snow.

This is the source code of the application on the Play Store: [Visual Snow](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.damianop.visualsnow)
